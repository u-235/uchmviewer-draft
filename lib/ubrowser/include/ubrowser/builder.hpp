/**
 * @brief The UBrowser::Builder class provides a plugin interface for creating a
 * UBrowser::Browser instance.
 *
 * The application obtains an instance of the UBrowser::Browser class using the
 * createController() method. However, before the first call to the this method,
 * the application calls the setUrlSchemes() and setDataDirectory() methods.
 * The plugin should store this information and pass it to the created
 * UBrowser::Browser instances as needed.
 *
 *
 * <h2>Information about plugin</h2>
 *
 * The kind(), hasOption() and hasFeature() methods inform the application about
 * the type of browser and supported options and features.
 *
 * The application uses the brief(), description(), and license() methods to
 * inform the user about the browser. These methods should return plain text.
 * The application, when displaying this text, removes single newline characters
 * with no space preceding them. Two newline characters result in a new
 * paragraph. This is similar to Markdown and is the only formatting available.
 * Information in English is mandatory. Information in other languages
 * (according to the locale of the application) is welcome.
 *
 * @see https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/plugins-howto.html
