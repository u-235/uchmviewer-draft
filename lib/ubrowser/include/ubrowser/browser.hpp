/**
 * @brief The UBrowser::Browser class provides an interface to display
 * documents.
 *
 * The application uses the UBrowser::Browser class to display eBook pages.
 * Hereinafter the word "browser" is used to mean "the UBrowser::Browser class
 * or its descendant". Depending on the implementation, there may be stubs
 * instead of some methods. For example, some implementation may not have page
 * printing or text selection and copying. The hasFeature() method is used to
 * inform the application of supported features. The browser may not have all
 * settings options via the configure() method, and the hasOption() method
 * should inform the application of supported options.
 *
 * The application passes a pointer to a UBrowser::ContentProvider instance to
 * the browser constructor. The UBrowser::ContentProvider class is the only way
 * to get content to display the page. The browser should not attempt to load
 * content from the network or any other way other than from the
 * UBrowser::ContentProvider. The application starts loading the page by calling
 * the load() or reload() method. The loading can also be triggered by the
 * management methods of the navigation history, discussed
 * @ref browser-feature-history "below". When the load is complete, the browser
 * emits the loadFinished() signal.
 *
 * The linkClicked() signal is emitted when a link is activated by any method
 * (mouse, Enter key, menu item, etc.) except for the link activation to the
 * anchor inside the current page. The browser must not load a page or create
 * a new one itself when activating a link - the application does this in
 * response to the linkClicked() signal. The browser must not create and show
 * a context menu, instead it must emit the contextMenuRequested() signal.
 *
 * When the URL changes, the urlChanged() signal is emitted. The URL can change
 * after the page loads or if the user clicks on a link to an anchor inside the
 * current page. The URL does not change when the page is reloaded.
 *
 * For integration into the GUI, the view() method returns a widget with the
 * page displayed. In the destructor, the browser should call deleteLater() of
 * the widget.
 *
 *
 * <h2>Additional features</h2>
 *
 * The methods and signals that must be fully implemented were listed above. The
 * following are additional features without which the application can work.
 * Note that for a supported feature, the browser must have a complete
 * implementation of all methods of that feature.
 *
 *
 * @anchor browser-feature-history
 * <h3>Navigation and history</h3>
 *
 * A browser that supports the history must meet the following conditions:
 *
 * * The hasFeature() method called with the UBrowser::FEATURE_HISTORY must
 *   return @c true.
 * * The canGoBack(), canGoForward(), back() and forward() methods must be fully
 *   implemented and the history() method must return not @c nullptr.
 * * When history changes, the historyChanged() signal is emitted.
 *
 *
 * @anchor browser-feature-copytext
 * <h3>Text selection and copying</h3>
 *
 * A browser that supports text copying must meet the following conditions:
 *
 * * The hasFeature() method called with the UBrowser::FEATURE_COPY must
 *   return @c true.
 * * The selectAll(), selectedCopy() and selectedText() methods must be fully
 *   implemented.
 *
 *
 * @anchor browser-feature-findtext
 * <h3>Searching in the text</h3>
 *
 * A browser that supports text searching must meet the following conditions:
 *
 * * The hasFeature() method called with the UBrowser::FEATURE_SEARCH must
 *   return @c true.
 * * The findText() method must be fully implemented.
 * * The  findTextFinished() signal must be emitted when the text search is
 *   finished.
 *
 *
 * @anchor browser-feature-print
 * <h3>Page printing</h3>
 *
 * A browser that supports page printing must meet the following conditions:
 *
 * * The hasFeature() method called with the UBrowser::FEATURE_PRINT must
 *   return @c true.
 * * The print() method must be fully implemented.
 * * The printFinished() signal should be emitted when printing of the page is
 *   complete.
 *
 *
 * @anchor browser-feature-zoom
 * <h3>Page zooming</h3>
 *
 * A browser that supports page zooming must meet the following conditions:
 *
 * * The hasFeature() method called with the UBrowser::FEATURE_ZOOM must
 *   return @c true.
 * * The zoomFactor() and setZoomFactorImpl() methods must be fully implemented.
 *
 *
 * @anchor browser-feature-scroll
 * <h3>Page scrolling</h3>
 *
 * A browser that supports page scrolling must meet the following conditions:
 *
 * * The hasFeature() method called with the UBrowser::FEATURE_SCROLL must
 *   return @c true.
 * * The scrollTop() and setScrollTop() methods must be fully implemented.
 *
